# üé≤ Lichess Random Move Selector

This is a Chrome extension that adds a "Play Random Move" button to the [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org) analysis board.  
When clicked, it selects a move from the list of suggested moves **at random, weighted by the percentage next to each move** and plays it on the board.

## How it Works

- The extension reads the table of moves shown on the analysis board
- Each move has an associated percentage (like 65%, 20%, etc.)
- It picks a move randomly, but **moves with higher percentages are more likely to be chosen**

### Does this work during live games?
No, it only works on the **analysis board**, where move suggestions are visible. 

### Does it break Lichess rules?
No, it doesn‚Äôt automate gameplay or cheat. It only interacts with the analysis interface, like a user would, and does not access any information from outside the page.

## üõ† Improvements?

The Lichess opening explorer rounds down percentage probabilities to 0% for rare moves, so our extension will never play them. We could calculate the percentage ourselves by reading the total number of times the position has been reached, and the number of times each move was played, both given in the table.
